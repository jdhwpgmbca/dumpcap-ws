<!--
 This is an example of a minimal Windows Service Wrapper configuration, which includes only mandatory options,
 *AND* a few environment variables that I've added for the pcapture service.
 
 This configuration file should be placed near the WinSW executable, the name should be the same.
 E.g. for myapp.exe the configuration file name should be myapp.xml
 
 You can find more information about the configuration options here: https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw/blob/master/doc/xmlConfigFile.md
 Full example: https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw/blob/master/examples/sample-allOptions.xml

  <!-- You will need to copy an OpenJDK 11 folder to this folder, and rename it to jre,
       as well as copying the ${project.build.finalName}-runner.jar.
       You should also copy an PKCS12 formatted file containing your SSL certificate
       and key into this directory and rename it to the name shown below for
       QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_STORE_FILE. You may also need to change the
       QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD below to match the export password
       used by your Network Administrator when the key was exported. It's important that
       this file contain both the key and the certificate.

       We get our OpenJDK's from https://adoptopenjdk.net
